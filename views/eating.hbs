  <h2 >How to deal with an Eating Disorder?</h2>
  <h4> In order to help get over an Eating Disorder then you would most likely need a treatment of some kind and usually would involve
    talking therepy. Due to the fact that simply putting on or losing weight won't easily fix the problem. Once you admit to yourself
    that you have a problem you can then go about getting the right treatment needed. So, you would take to a therapist to help you through
    the problems and they'll help you by giving you a self-guided help problem to ensure you can help yourself too.
